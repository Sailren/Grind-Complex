# Arch's Grind Complex Supreme

My very own modpack built around Gregtech Hard Mode with a focus on complexity and especially extending the gameplay.

Do you like challenges ? Do you like complexity ? Do you like challenges ? Do you like being kicked there by a raging kid right where it hurts ? Nope ? Not the latter. Well too bad. This is what my pack reminds me the most of. Pain. The mod selection aims to provide something that's challenging on all aspects. Be it for the overall recipe complexity, the much tougher mobs, hunger/regen mechanics, or even the added physics, I made all I could to keep this pack as hard and complex as possible while still trying to preserve the sweet, sweet tiering and balance of GregTech.

*** THE PROGESSION. *** - And why this pack is a bitch.

You'll notice right from the beginning, things might get nasty quickly. However, once you beat that part, you will feel you achieved something already. With both Spice Of Life and Hunger Overhaul (And they're not configured to be easy on you. ;]), just feeding yourself will be a pain, believe me. I know the pack inside and out so I now sorta breeze through it (Still suffering a few casualties here and there though...) but I figure not everybody will go through it that way. ;] With the added Thirst and Body Temperature aspect added by Enviromine, just surviving at first will be a thing of all instants.

Tools AND Weapon are provided by Tinker's Constructs and all other Weapons and Tools are disabled. (Except for GregTech's tool which are available after the pre-game phase only.) Iguana Tinker Tweaks provides some nice, much-needed progression and customization to Tinker's. The more you use tools, the more random enchants you get. Additional modifiers are disabled and you only get to choose ONE modifier once you've mastered the tool. The others you'll be getting are -random-. The probability to get Auto-Repair has been lowered and balls of moss will require quite some exploring in the TF, so the tools are not free either. Basically, the nice mechanics of Tinker without the overpowered weapons. And for once, weapons that will really follow you through the games. From Stone level to Manyullyn level if you wish, as you can change the head and keep on mining to higher tiers ! Trust me, you'll grow fond of them. ;]

Once you get a hold of yourself, get some food running and a few weapons... It's time for exploration ! Be sure to have a Sleeping Bag with you, 'cause really you don't want to have to go through the night. ;] With support from Special Mobs and Infernal Mobs , mobs are really a terror at first when you have no room over your head and not even enough to afford an armor. Since the pack uses Random Things' Hardcore Darkness which makes everything pitch black unless lit... And also uses Zombie Awareness, you which make zombies follow lights... You really have no other option but to skip the night. Or enjoy a swift death. ;] All life from all mob has been doubled or even tripled. Don't worry though, for support is available. Be it for Blocklings, MCA's villagers or even... A... Tiny... Maid, make sure to have an ally by your side !

Once some exploration is done and you've found a few veins of ores... It's time to mine ! About the mining... This is GregTech oregen all the way, as we like it... However the locations of the ores themselves has been changed, requiring you to go to no less than 7 of the dimensions we have available to get all the ores... Namely the Overworld, the Twilight Forest, the Nether, the End and Galacticraft's Moon, Mars and Asteroids. All other ores from all other mods have been disabled unless this was impossible and replaced by their GregTech's equivalent. Once again, challenging stuff.

All in all... Good luck. =]

P.S : There's also an end-game surprise if you manage to get there. ;D



*** THE RECIPES **** - And why I have no more life.

Here comes... The meat and potatoes of this pack of mine, the recipes ! And they're hard, I mean it. Hard, grindy and complex. This is the WIP part of the modpack. (And, will this ever end ?) While I did try to touch a bit of all mods, changing most recipes for a staggering 150 mods is a lenghty task for a single man. (If you know how to use Minetweaker and feel like helping... Please, be my bi- -my guest. If you have any idea on how to improve this, I want to hear it. Better yet, if you have many ideas, just fork the project, add a bit to it and if I like what I see I'll merge it and credit you.) A few mods are complete as of now and I'm working as often as I can to get it as complete and as balanced as possible. Even the vanilla Minecraft recipes are greatly altered such as my legendary Piston recipe. First time you get to craft one... And realise you need to get an Alloy Smelter to get it... Pushing your thrusty Macerator one machine further... What a great time.

I try to extend the gameplay of MineCraft, sort of like GregTech tries to do (And suceeds pretty well.) using other mods, providing many different tiers to all aspect of your tech progression, be it automation, bee breeding or just about anything. and try to make every mod feel like it has always been a part of GT, sometimes altering the original recipes to great extent, to recipes that are more Greg-ish or just recipes that I find more pleasant to look at. The pack currently has almost half a megabyte of Custom Recipes in scripts (Or 10K+ lines), more than any other modpack I know of. And I'm far from done. To accomodate my needs I've also started working on a small "mod" I'll be using to add bunch of little things to the game. Already have a dozen so far. Feel free to grab it and use it, just credit me somewhere. Same goes for the scripts, of course.

All in all. Have fun. :3

*** THE SERVER. *** - TL;DR, this is the part you really want.

* The rules : I won't make it really long... 'Cause rules are boring (Although necessary.). Don't be an ass. Is all. Of course, this implies a bunch of things. I like to call this COMMON SENSE. Do not steal, do not grief, do not destroy other people's stuff... Simple, isn't it ? So simple because I'll be there all the time, and if you act like a jerk, you're out. (Sounds frightening, but really, it isn't.

* The server : I have a dedicated server running 2 different Minecraft worlds, both being linked by qCraft portals, allowing to split the workload between two servers. The server specs are as follow : Xeon 1230-V3 @ 3.7Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1600MHz RAM and 1 sufficient 120GB SSD used for SWAP and of course the world. As you can see, not a bad server at all. Do note however that some mods in the pack are REALLY expensive to run ressource-wise, so judgement and care must be used when travelling.

* Okay, think I'm done. If you're interested after all this, there's 3 ways to contact me so I can give you the necessary files. (Scripts and whatnot.) I'll put them here in order of efficiency.
FIRST. Communicate with me on the official TeamSpeak. (IP :   162.219.27.202 /// Password :   ftc) This is where you'll end up grabbing most of the updates anyway, so might as well get used to it now. I should answer you and allow you in pretty much instantly that way.
SECOND. Send me a message on the IC2 forums. I see these every day or so, maybe less.
THIRD. Leave a message in my thread on the IC2 forums.
