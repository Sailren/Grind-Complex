# ArchCraft

Modpack centered around Gregtech Hard Mode.


*** THE MOD SELECTION. And why this pack is a bitch. ***


The mod selection aims to provide something that's challenging on all aspects. The beginning is especially tough, but once you beat that, you will feel you achieved something. With both Spice Of Life and Hunger Overhaul, just feeding yourself will be a pain, believe me. Especially with the added Thirst and Body Temp (Which I still must balance, I wouldn't recommend in the meantine...) from Enviromine. (Currently only enabled features... Beside physics. ;])

Tools AND Weapon are provided by Tinker's Constructs and all other Weapons and Tools are disabled. Iguana Tinker Tweaks provide some nice progression. The more you use tools, the more random enchants you get. Additional modifiers are disabled but for the nether star and you only get one you get to choose at Level 15. The 4 others you'll be getting are -random-. The recipe for moss is really expensive (Really. ;]) and will require quite some exploring in the TF, so the tools are not free either.
Basically, the nice mechanics of Tinker without overpowered weapons. And for once, weapons that will really follow you through the games. From Stone level to Manyullyn level if you wish, as you can change the head and keep on mining to higher tiers !

Once you get a hold of yourself, get some food running and a few weapons... It's time for exploration ! Be sure to have a Sleeping Bag with you, 'cause really you don't want to gave to go through the night. ;] With support from Special Mobs, Infernal Mobs , mobs are really a terror at first when you have no room over your head and not even enough to afford an armor.
And since the pack uses Random Things' Hardcore Darkness which makes everything pitch black unless Lit... And because of Zombie Awareness, you which make zombies follow you unless Dark... You really have no other option but to skip the night.

Once some exploration is done and you've found a few veins of ores... It's time to mine ! About the mining... This is GregTech oregen all the way, as we like it... However the locations of the ores themselves has been changed, requiring you to go to 6 of the dimensions we have available to get all the ores... Namely the Twilight Forest, The Nether, The End, Galacticraft's Moon, Mars and Asteroids.

All in all. Good luck. =]


*** THE RECIPES. And why I have no more life. ***


Enough custom recipes to make your eyes bleed. And they're hard, I mean it. Hard, grindy and complicated. Even the vanilla Minecraft recipes are greatly altered such as my legendary Piston recipe. First time you get to craft one... And realise you need to get an Alloy Smelter to get it... Pushing your thrusty Macerator one machine further... What a great time.

I try to extend the gameplay of GregTech with other mods and try to make every mod feel like a part of GT, sometimes altering the original recipes to great extent. The pack has almost 500kb of Custom Recipes, more than any other modpack I know of. And I'm far from done.
To accomodate my needs I've started working on a small mod I'll be using to add bunch of little things to the game. Already have a dozen so far. Feel free to grab it and use it, just credit me somewhere.

Most configs are made by myself (And I'm currently replacing those that are not mine so it feels more uniform) I do however accept suggestions on recipes. If you have any idea on how to improve this, I want to hear it. ;] Better yet, if you have many ideas, just fork the project, add a bit to it and if I like what I see I'll merge it and credit you.

All in all. Have fun. :3 And play as a team, it's much better.


*** THE OFFICIAL SERVER. And why it's not open. ***


I used to have a server with someone else, but we did not envision the same things with the pack so we split. Meaning at the moment the official server is closed. It should however re-open before 1st of February. And maybe as early as the 19th of January. In the meantime, I'm free and will do all I can to make as much recipes as possible to make it ready by then.
